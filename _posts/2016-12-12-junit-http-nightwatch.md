I've been working on a greybox testing strategy for my company,
Cantina for a while now, and I've written the first versions of the
libraries to support it, one for the [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/)
backend, and one for the [Nightwatch](http://nightwatchjs.org)
frontend. You can find them here:

* [JUnit HTTP](https://github.com/cantinac/junit-http)
* [Nightwatch Remote Assert](https://github.com/cantinac/nightwatch-js-remote-assert)

I'll be publishing some articles about how I arrived at this strategy
and how to use it in the near future. Unit then, you can check out the
in-progress
[field guide](http://field-guide.cantina.co.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/#dev-process),
which contains an overview of my development process which covers testing.
