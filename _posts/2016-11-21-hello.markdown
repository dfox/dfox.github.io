As long as I've been a software developer, I've yet to really put
myself out there and create a personal website. That's pretty rare,
and some would say unacceptable for people in my line of work. So in
an effort to grow a little and get over some of my
[hesitancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome),
I've decided to put up this site.
