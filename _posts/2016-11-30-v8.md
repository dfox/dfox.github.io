I really like V8 juice. A lot. I drink it almost every day. I also try
to make all my own food, so naturally I decided to try some
taste-alike recipes. Almost immediately I found out that V8 is
actually cooked, and to make it you essentially make a soup. Also, a
lot of the recipes used things like a food mill or a sieve to filter
the juice from the roughage. I didn't like either of these aspects of
the recipes because I wanted a raw product with all of the fiber and
goodness. So essentially I made a smoothy with the V8 veggies.

The ingredients on a V8 can are:

* Tomato Juice from Concentrate (Water, Tomato Paste)
* Reconstituted Vegetable Juice Blend (Water and Concentrated Juices of Carrots, Celery, Beets, Parsley, Lettuce, Watercress, Spinach)
* Lemon Juice from Concentrate (Water, Lemon Juice Concentrate)
* Salt
* Natural Flavoring
* Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)
* Citric Acid

As you can see, it's very much "from concentrate" and definitely not
organic. It seemed like an easy task to blend up the ingredients in
the Vitamix and tweak to taste. After looking at some other recipes,
this is what I came up with:

* 3 tomatoes
* 1 carrot
* 2 celery sticks
* 1/4 of a small beet
* A handful each of:
  * Parsley
  * Romaine lettuce
  * Watercress
  * Spinach
* Juice from 1/2 lemon
* A few dashes of Worcestershire
* Salt and pepper to taste

I went easy on the watercress and parsley, as those offer up a lot of
flavor. You can add a bunch of lettuce and spinach and not change the
taste too much. The result was really, really tasty. Not exactly like
V8, but close, and so much more "fresh" tasting.
