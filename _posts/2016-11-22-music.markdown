I DJ and produce electronic music as a professional hobby. I've been a resident DJ at
[Elements](http://elements-dnb.com) for about 5 years now and perform around New England at various events. From around 2007-2012, I was a member of the group,
The Statesmen. We had quite a few releases and also a number of unreleased tracks
that never quite made it to a label. I've posted some of them [here](/music/).
